h1. Curator 5.0 Breaking Changes

Curator 5.0 contains a few non\-backward compatible/breaking changes from previous versions.

* ZooKeeper 3.4.x is no longer supported (the associated {{Compatibility}} classes/methods have been removed). If you still
need to use Curator with ZooKeeper 3.4.x you will need to use a previous version. [[Click here for details|zk-compatibility-34.html]].
* The old {{ListenerContainer}} classes have been removed so as not to leak Guava classes into Curator APIs. Instead use the new {{StandardListenerManager}}.
* Exhibitor support has been removed.
* {{ConnectionHandlingPolicy}} and related classes have been removed.
* The {{Reaper}} and {{ChildReaper}} classes/recipes have been removed. You should use ZooKeeper container nodes instead.
* {{newPersistentEphemeralNode()}} and {{newPathChildrenCache()}} were removed from {{GroupMember}}.
* {{ServiceCacheBuilder<T> executorService(CloseableExecutorService executorService)}} was removed from {{ServiceCacheBuilder}}.
* {{ServiceProviderBuilder<T> executorService(CloseableExecutorService executorService)}} was removed from {{ServiceProviderBuilder}}.
* {{static boolean shouldRetry(int rc)}} was removed from {{RetryLoop}}.
* {{static boolean isRetryException(Throwable exception)}} was removed from {{RetryLoop}}.
