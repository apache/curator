/**
 * <p>
 *     A proxy for connection state listeners that adds circuit breaking behavior. During network
 *     outages ZooKeeper can become very noisy sending connection/disconnection events in rapid succession.
 *     Curator recipes respond to these messages by resetting state, etc. E.g. LeaderLatch must delete
 *     its lock node and try to recreate it in order to try to re-obtain leadership, etc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     This noisy herding can be avoided by using the circuit breaking listener. When it
 *     receives {@link org.apache.curator.framework.state.ConnectionState#SUSPENDED}, the circuit
 *     becomes "open" (based on the provided {@link org.apache.curator.RetryPolicy}) and will ignore
 *     future connection state changes until RetryPolicy timeout has elapsed. Note: however, if the connection
 *     goes from {@link org.apache.curator.framework.state.ConnectionState#SUSPENDED} to
 *     {@link org.apache.curator.framework.state.ConnectionState#LOST} the first LOST state <i>is</i> sent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     When the circuit is closed, all connection state changes are forwarded to the managed
 *     listener. When the first disconnected state is received, the circuit becomes open. The state change
 *     that caused the circuit to open is sent to the managed listener and the RetryPolicy will be used to
 *     get a delay amount. While the delay is active, the circuit breaker will store state changes but will not
 *     forward them to the managed listener (except, however, the first time the state changes from SUSPENDED to LOST).
 *     When the delay elapses, if the connection has been restored, the circuit closes and forwards the
 *     new state to the managed listener. If the connection has not been restored, the RetryPolicy is checked
 *     again. If the RetryPolicy indicates another retry is allowed the process repeats. If, however, the
 *     RetryPolicy indicates that retries are exhausted then the circuit closes - if the current state
 *     is different than the state that caused the circuit to open it is forwarded to the managed listener.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     <strong>NOTE:</strong> You should not use this listener directly. Instead, set {@link org.apache.curator.framework.state.ConnectionStateListenerManagerFactory#circuitBreaking(org.apache.curator.RetryPolicy)}
 *     in the {@link org.apache.curator.framework.CuratorFrameworkFactory.Builder#connectionStateListenerManagerFactory(ConnectionStateListenerManagerFactory)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     E.g.
 * <code><pre>
 * ConnectionStateListenerManagerFactory factory = ConnectionStateListenerManagerFactory.circuitBreaking(...retry policy for circuit breaking...);
 * CuratorFramework client = CuratorFrameworkFactory.builder()
 *     .connectionStateListenerManagerFactory(factory)
 *     ... etc ...
 *     .build();
 * // all connection state listeners set for "client" will get circuit breaking behavior
 * </pre></code>
