 * <p>
 *     The general form for this interface is:
 * </p>
 *     <pre>
 *         curator.inTransaction().operation().arguments().forPath(...).
 *             and().more-operations.
 *             and().commit();
 *     </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Here's an example that creates two nodes in a transaction
 * </p>
 *     <pre>
 *         curator.inTransaction().
 *             create().forPath("/path-one", path-one-data).
 *             and().create().forPath("/path-two", path-two-data).
 *             and().commit();
 *     </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *     <b>Important:</b> the operations are not submitted until
 *     {@link CuratorTransactionFinal#commit()} is called.
