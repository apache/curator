     * <p>
     *     Hat-tip to https://github.com/sbridges for pointing this out
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     It turns out there is an edge case that exists when creating sequential-ephemeral
     *     nodes. The creation can succeed on the server, but the server can crash before
     *     the created node name is returned to the client. However, the ZK session is still
     *     valid so the ephemeral node is not deleted. Thus, there is no way for the client to
     *     determine what node was created for them.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     Even without sequential-ephemeral, however, the create can succeed on the sever
     *     but the client (for various reasons) will not know it.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     Putting the create builder into protection mode works around this.
     *     The name of the node that is created is prefixed with a GUID. If node creation fails
     *     the normal retry mechanism will occur. On the retry, the parent path is first searched
     *     for a node that has the GUID in it. If that node is found, it is assumed to be the lost
     *     node that was successfully created on the first try and is returned to the caller.
     * </p>
