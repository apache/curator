# Code analysis

The `run-coverage.sh` script runs maven with the coverage profile which generates the test coverage
data for java classes.
If the required parameters are given it also runs the sonar analysis and uploads the results to the
given SonarQube Server.

## Running code analysis

After running the script the code coverage results generated by the JaCoCo library can be found
under the `/target/jacoco-coverage/` folder of every module.

Here is how you can generate the code coverage reports:

```sh dev-support/code-coverage/run-coverage.sh ```

## Publishing coverage results to SonarQube

The required parameters for publishing the results to SonarQube are:

- host URL,
- login credentials,
- project key

The project name is an optional parameter.

Here is an example command for running and publishing the coverage data:

```sh dev-support/code-coverage/run-coverage.sh -l LoginCredentials -u https://exampleserver.com -k Key -n Name```
