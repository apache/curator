h1. Curator Cache

*Note: * CuratorCache requires ZooKeeper 3.6\+.

h2. Description

Will respond to update/create/delete events, pull down the data, etc. You can register listeners that will get notified when changes occur.

h2. Participating Classes
* CuratorCache
* CuratorCacheListener
* ChildData

h2. Usage
h3. Creating a CuratorCache
{code}
CuratorCache.build(CuratorFramework client, String path, Options... options)

Parameters:
client - the client
path - path to watch
options - empty or one or more options
{code}

Note: there is a builder factory available for additional options when building the cache instance. See {{CuratorCacheBuilder}} for details.

h2. General Usage
The cache must be started by calling {{start()}}. Call {{close()}} when you are through with the cache.

At any time, call {{storage()}} to get the current state cache. You can also register to be notified when a change occurs by calling {{listenable()}} and then registering
a listener for events.

See the examples for an example usage.

h2. Error Handling
CuratorCache instances internally monitor connection losses, etc. automatically rebuilding the cache on reconnection.
