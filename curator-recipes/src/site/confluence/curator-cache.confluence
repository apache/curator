h2. Participating Classes
* CuratorCache
* CuratorCacheListener
* ChildData

h2. Usage
h3. Creating a CuratorCache
{code}
CuratorCache.build(CuratorFramework client, String path, Options... options)

Parameters:
client - the client
path - path to watch
options - empty or one or more options
{code}

Note: there is a builder factory available for additional options when building the cache instance. See {{CuratorCacheBuilder}} for details.

h2. General Usage
The cache must be started by calling {{start()}}. Call {{close()}} when you are through with the cache.

At any time, call the various accessor methods to get the current state of the cache. You can also register to be notified when a change occurs by calling {{listenable()}} and then registering
a listener for events.

See the examples for an example usage.

h2. Error Handling
CuratorCache instances internally monitor connection losses, etc. automatically rebuilding the cache on reconnection.
