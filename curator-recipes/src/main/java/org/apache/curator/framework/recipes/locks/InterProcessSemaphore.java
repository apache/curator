/**
 * <p>
 *     A counting semaphore that works across JVMs. All processes
 *     in all JVMs that use the same lock path will achieve an inter-process limited set of leases.
 *     Further, this semaphore is mostly "fair" - each user will get a lease in the order requested
 *     (from ZK's point of view).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     There are two modes for determining the max leases for the semaphore. In the first mode the
 *     max leases is a convention maintained by the users of a given path. In the second mode a
 *     {@link SharedCountReader} is used as the method for semaphores of a given path to determine
 *     the max leases.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     If a {@link SharedCountReader} is <b>not</b> used, no internal checks are done to prevent
 *     Process A acting as if there are 10 leases and Process B acting as if there are 20. Therefore,
 *     make sure that all instances in all processes use the same numberOfLeases value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     The various acquire methods return {@link Lease} objects that represent acquired leases. Clients
 *     must take care to close lease objects  (ideally in a <code>finally</code>
 *     block) else the lease will be lost. However, if the client session drops (crash, etc.),
 *     any leases held by the client are
 *     automatically closed and made available to other clients.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link InterProcessSemaphoreV2} instead of this class. It uses a better algorithm.
