/**
 * <p>
 *     A utility that attempts to keep the data from a node locally cached. Optionally the entire
 *     tree of children below the node can also be cached. Will respond to update/create/delete events, pull
 *     down the data, etc. You can register listeners that will get notified when changes occur.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     <b>IMPORTANT</b> - Due to how ZooKeeper works you will not get notified of every single event.
 *     For example during a network partition the cache will not get events. Imagine the following scenario:
 *
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Pre-network partition the cache contains "/foo" and "/foo/bar"</li>
 *         <li>A network partition occurs and your Curator client loses connection to the server</li>
 *         <li>Image another client that isn't partitioned, deletes "/foo/bar" and then a third client re-creates "/foo/bar"</li>
 *         <li>Your client's partition is fixed. The cache will only see <em>one</em> change - the third client's re-create</li>
 *     </ul>
 *
 *     Additionally, remember that ZooKeeper is an eventual consistent system. Always use ZNode version
 *     numbers when updating nodes.
 * </p>
