## What's is Apache Curator?

Apache Curator is a Java/JVM client library for [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), a distributed coordination service.

Apache Curator includes a high-level API framework and utilities to make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier and more reliable. It also includes recipes for common use cases and extensions such as service discovery and a Java 8 asynchronous DSL.
